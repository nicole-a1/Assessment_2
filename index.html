			<br></br>
			<h2>Myers-Briggs Test Results</h2>
                        <img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-myers-briggs.png" alt="team myers briggs 1" />
			<br></br>
			<img  id ="pimg" src="./img/team-myers-briggs-personality-test2.png" alt="team myers briggs 2" />
			<br></br>
			<p>The Myers-Briggs personality test attempts to categorise the personalities of individuals into one of 16
				different types based on the theories of Carl G Jung (The Myers & Briggs Foundation 2021). Though this
				particular test has been found to be practically meaningless, it is still commonly used in the workplace
				and
				in educational institutions as a way to analyse the abilities or personal profiles of individuals
				(Strombert and Caswell 2015). </p>
			<br></br>
			<p>Having each taken the Myers-Briggs test though as a way to get to know each other as a team, the results
				have been complied
				in the graphs above. It can clearly be seen that the group is made up of individuals with very different
				personalities.
				Despite this, the results would indicate that while there are varying tendencies, they appear to be
				quite moderate, with the
				majority of traits being represented as a balance between two extremes for most of the team.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>A team comprised of individuals with different profiles, especially when considering these profiles tend
				to be in the
				moderate range of between 30 to 80% is extremely beneficial. In a setting such as this where a team is
				working in the IT
				field, the lack of extremes in traits such as being intuitive/observant or thinking/feeling would
				minimise the extent to
				which disagreements and issues arise with individuals at opposites ends of the scale. Also, for those
				individuals with extreme
				tendencies (for example, introversion or assertiveness) would be tempered by the personalities of the
				other members of the group,
				hopefully enabling the team to work effectively and efficiently together to progress towards a common
				goal.</p>
                                                   <h2>Big-Five visual Team Test Results </h2>
			<br></br>
			<img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-big-five-personality-test.png" alt="team big five" />
			<br></br>
			<p>The Big Five personality test aims to provide a statistical result in relation to a series of questions
				relating to five personality traits being: extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness,
				conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. From the above graph, we can see that the group is made up
				of individuals with very different profiles. There is a wide range of results for all categories.</p>
			<p>The differences in all these traits will hopefully contribute to a balanced group dynamic where different
				ideas are able to be brought to the table and different approaches to working will help to keep the
				project moving forward and on track. For example, the differences in the intellect/imagination traits
				will enable effective discussions in relation to conventional versus more imaginative ideas and
				approaches and may provide unique perspectives as the group works to a common goal. </p>
			<p>Though there are some extreme differences, such as across the extroversion and intellect/imagination
				traits, the consistent levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness across the group is likely to help
				lessen the impacts of any disagreements that may arise, and provides an environment where each team
				member can contribute effectively. </p>
			<br></br>
                                            <h2>The VARK Questionnaire Visual Team Test Results </h2>
			<br></br>
			<img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-vark-questionnaire.png" alt="team vark" />
			<p>Throughout the years, many studies have been conducted around the validity and accuracy of learning style
				assessments. While the majority of these studies have found that knowing a person's preferred manner of
				learning (visual, auditory, text or practical based) does not help them learn more effectively by
				tailoring learning styles to suit individuals, they are still widely used as an assessment tool in
				educational institutions today (Reynolds 2021). </p>
			<p>Having each conducted the VARK learning test, we can clearly see in the above graph that while it appears
				that kinesthetic is the preferred method of learning for the group, all other modes of learning are
				still represented. This would indicate a team that would be able to process and share information in a
				variety of ways to ensure the group is able to effectively work together towards a common goal.</p>

                                                <p><h4>Future Team’s Job titles in demand:</h4>
						<img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-ideal-jobs-demand.png" alt="team's ideal jobs in demand" />
						<p>As a group, there is a variety of ideal jobs, each having a different focus in the IT
							industry. From the above graph, it is clear that by far, the most in demand job is for
							cybersecurity analysts. This is also reflected in the fact that the ideal jobs of two
							members of a team of six is cybersecurity analyst. With the increase in the use of online
							services, it is obvious that security is going to play a major role in the future as more of
							our personal and sensitive information is uploaded onto the internet in particular, thus
							fuelling the demand to protect this data. By 2026, it is predicted that there will be an
							additional 17,600 jobs for cybersecurity analysts.</p>
						<p>The next highest demand is in relation to cloud architects. The reasons for the demand for
							cybersecurity analysts can also be seen to be contributing factors in the demand for cloud
							architects. From 2018 to 2021, there has been an 11% increase in self-identified cloud
							architects. No doubt this figure will continue to rise as more industries take advantage of
							developments in this field, moving their operations to the cloud to reduce their costs and
							increase efficiency, with further benefits in choice, scalability, speed, integration,
							auditing and compliance, and business continuity planning (Saint-Marc 2014). </p>
						<p>Next in demand is DevOps, with expectations of around 30% growth by 2025. Similar to the
							growth in demand for cybersecurity analysts and cloud architects, the increasing use of
							software and developments in IT technologies and the fact that many businesses are now
							moving much of their process into the cloud has contributed greatly to the demand for DevOps
							engineers, especially in terms of facilitating effective collaboration between software
							development and IT teams (DevopsCurry 2020). </p>
						<p>Software quality assurance engineers are next in demand. So far they appear to have a small
							presence in the industry with only 640 persons employed in this role in 2016 in Australia,
							but would appear to have strong growth outcomes, reaching levels of 34% growth by 2025. Like
							all the ideal jobs described previously, developments and improvements in terms of software
							will require software quality assurance engineers to ensure that the end product provides
							the desired outcome.</p>
						<p>Finally, though it seems to have the smallest demand, growth in the ICT support technician
							field is expected to increase from 65,800 in 2018 to 77,900 by 2023. As with all other IT
							positions, the increase in the number of people accessing and using IT technologies will
							lead to the requirement for consistent and ongoing support. ICT support technicians are
							often the first point of contact for end users to provide technical support and assistance
							for users of computer infrastructure and web technologies.</p>
						<p>Though there are differences in terms of job roles and technical skills required for each
							job, people employed in these positions often work as a team in order to provide services to
							the consumer. For example, when working on a particular project involving cloud
							architecture, obviously a cloud architect would be required to head the project, designing
							the architecture to suit the client's instructions. DevOps would be involved to ensure the
							appropriate software and technologies are being utilised, while software engineering
							analysts are needed to ensure the technologies utilised work correctly for the client.
							Cybersecurity analysts and IT support technicians would likely be involved in the ongoing
							support and security for the clients and other end users (Sheehy 2019).</p>

						<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<h2>Cybersecurity by Steven Pigatto. S3851506</h2>
					<h3>What does it do?</h3>
					<p> Cyber threats have come to be more prominent in the early 2000’s this is when the internet
						was more available for people to start using it.
						Once coding was available, threats such as malware coding could be produced. With the world
						fast approaching modern technology,
						which will result in a big surge of threats daily, A virus that was circulating in the
						2000’s was affecting Microsoft systems called “ILOVEYOU” which was an attachment on an
						e-mail.
						This caused damage to data and would also send copies to people on your e-mail list. </p>
					<p> Cybersecurity is a practice for protecting systems, network, and programs from digital
						attacks.
						The practice enables defending against malware, Phishing via e-mail, distributed
						denial-of-service (DDoS)
						attacks and ransom attacks on personal and corporate sensitive data. Cybersecurity provides
						a layer of protection against any threat that arises against data,
						infrastructure and tools that could be stolen.
						It has become one of the most important tools due to the increase of activate movement of
						data and sensitive information over the internet. </p>
					<p> Humans are the weakest link when it comes to cybersecurity. Human errors recur and that’s
						when computer systems come vulnerable.
						This is when countermeasures are required. Software, hardware, and procedures is requiring
						preventing applications from external threats.
						Software design and security development has become more important. As more application are
						enable to accessible over the network,
						this would result in more threats. This has applications building its own security to try
						minimising unauthorized code trying to manipulate data.</p>
					<p> Countermeasures have been put into place to prevent threats or unauthorized users accessing
						information or hardware.
						Different software and have been developed to prevent attacks: </p>
					<p><strong>Security system</strong> helps control any access to the computer.
						The security system can also block any traffic that it concedes to be harmful to the system.
						The software is design to restrict incoming or outgoing traffic and protects data from
						applications installed on the computer. </p>
					<p><strong> Routers</strong> are able to prevent IP addresses of the user’s computer be visible on the net
						to prevent hacking.
						The VPN is the identity of the network, the router helps to protect all activity and its
						identity, by doing this helps prevent any data theft. </p>
					<p><strong>Encryption software</strong> is when messages that are sent would be converted into meaningless
						text. The software is design to keep sensitive information to be kept secret and can only be
						decrypted by the receiver.
						The decrypted software converts the encrypted text back to the correct format. </p>
					<p><strong>Anti-virus programs</strong> help protect your computer from virus. Virus such as malware can
						apply itself to applications by coding.
						The anti-virus software scans the computer files to identify any threats inside your system
						and removes them. </p>
					<p><strong>Spyware detection software</strong> is design to remove any traces of spyware in your computer
						system. Spyware is design to prevent any glitches in your system, therefore users do not
						detect the attachment.
						Spyware can be in malware form or through cookies, the tracking system of your internet.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Biometric Authentication Systems</strong> works by comparing two sets of data which the data
						requires to be nearly identical. Once the data is matched, it will give the required access
						to the person. The data cannot be exactly matched because it is impossible to have two sets
						100% the same. This helps prevent hackers be able to get access to the sensitive information
						or hardware because it's harder for them to collect the information unless they are near
						you.
						However, If the system was bypassed, the hacker risks getting caught easer then an outside
						hacker. </p>
                                         <p><u>Biometric methods:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Fingerprint scanners. </li>
						<li>Retina scanners.</li>
						<li>Iris scanners. </li>
						<li>Speaker recognition. </li>
						<li>Facial recognition systems. </li>
						<li>Hand and finger geometry.</li>
						<li>Vein geometry.</li>
						<li>DNA based.</li>
						<li>Behavioural Identifiers such as Typing recognition and Gait biometrics. </li>
					</ul>
					</p>
                                        
					<h3>What is the Likely Impact?</h3>
					<p>With the future facing more threats due to the extant on technology has been available,
						Organizations must be smarter in how they protect their data. This is when the following
						methods come in place according to
						Navigating New Cyber Risks pp 125-135 Under Future Solitons written by Ganna Pogrebna & Mark
						Skilton. </p>
                                         
					<h4><u>Scenario Testing:</u></h4>
					<p>Organizations could simulate different attacks to understand the potential impact it could
						have on their business.
						By doing this, the data that was collected can be used to create a risk assessment and
						develop a risk management plain to try
						stop any future attacks. </p>
                                        <
					h4><u>Terraforming Cyberspace:</u></h4>
					<p> This exciting technology would be hard to get pass by.
						Terraforming would work by removing any possible human related risks such as human errors or
						abuse to the software and hardware.
						The technology would possible be ran by AI or quantum computing.
						Terraforming could be reality soon and this could eliminate the use of Cybersecurity
						analysts. </p>
                                       
					<h4><u>Cryptography of the Future:</u></h4>
					<p> With new developing technology fast approaching, using encryption will become obsolete.
						Other tools to help keep and manage passwords safe at the highest level of security will be
						the way of the future. </p>
                                       
					<h4><u>Zero-knowledge proofs:</u></h4>
					<p>defined as “a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the
						verifier) that something is true,
						without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true”
						If this vision is successfully adopted,
						it would be very use-full in levels which could protect people’s identity and privacy. </p>
                                        <h4><u>Mobile Targets:</u></h4>
					<p>An attack on a mobile which resulted in data breaches would require the Tech company to
						adjust all data that was attached and the toolbox as well.
						Instead of doing this, creating an index for the targeted phone would make it impossible for
						the hacker to do their job. </p>
                                        
					<h4><u>Algorithmic active Cyber defence:</u></h4>
					<p>This type of defence uses traps to help lure and capture any interruptions caused by hackers.
						This technology is already in place. The future for this technology will be more practice in
						systems in the future.
						The traps would be well calculated that it would be more effective in capturing,
						diagnostics, and even future threats.</p>
					<p>The future of Cybersecurity looks strong. Having this possible innovative technology to fight
						cybercrime would be harder for any breaches to occur.
						However, the impact in having them in place could cost jobs.
						It would replace an entire range of cyber jobs because it would be less human interactive
						because majority would be algorithm controlled. </p>
                                        
					<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
					<p> Growing up in the early 90’s and the 2000’s and see the advancement of technology was so
						excited I could not get enough of it.
						I remember the diel up internet which I thought was the bees’ knees. Playing games and
						chatting to friends on MSN and IQ after school while doing homework was fun.
						I do not recall anything about security, except for a Firewall and Anti-Virus software. Back
						then, I did not know what that was out there could harm the computer. </p>
					
					<p> After doing this research, I have learnt a lot of dangerous software in the cyber web that
						could do lots of damage that I was not aware of existence.
						This is a real revelation, not just for myself but for my family and friends as well.</p>
					
					<p> With technology advancing each year, more dangerous the world wide web will become.
						Having a 5-year-old with iPad is concerning because they access the web.
						I rely on Apple’s security system to keep the iPad safe from harmful things. Sure, I could
						just monitor the usage, but I cannot be there 24/7.
						If the iPad were compromised, my phone could be next due to the linking of Apple products.
					</p>
					<p>Seeing new software emerge in the market is a good sign we will be protected from outside
						interference.
						Having products with the latest security features such as fingerprinting, and face
						recognition software installed is a wonderful thing.
						Not only it will stop unauthorized access but also protecting all our information and all
						passwords.
						However, the fingerprint scanning can be time consuming because sometimes and it fail then
						you need to go through the process of putting your passwords in.</p>
					
					<p> Looking into the future, I feel at ease for my growing family. My kids will have one of the
						strongest security systems in the world working before they understand about all this. But
						having all this security still does not stop online behaviour such as bullying.
						We should investigate software that detects unwanted behaviour so we could stamp it out
						completely. </p>
                                        
					<h2>Natural Language Processing and Chatbots By Nicole Attard - S3924819</h2>
					
					<h3>What does it do?</h3>
					<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence which refers to the
						use of computational techniques to "learn, understand and produce human language content"
						(Hirschberg & Manning 2015). In other words, a computer will receive input from a user,
						either in a written or oral form, gain an understanding of the content and then respond
						appropriately. Given the complexities of human language, especially with verbal
						communication, NLP combines "statistical, machine learning and deep learning models" (IBM
						Cloud Education 2020) in order to derive meaning and provide the desired outcome. </p>
					<p>Machine learning is a key element of natural language processing. By providing learning
						algorithms with large amounts of data relating to languages, the computer is able to learn
						more effectively how to identify the intent, categorise the request and respond in a
						conversational format (IBM Cloud Education 2020). </p>
					<img src="./img/nlp.png" alt="How Natural Language Processing Works" />
					<p>(AthenaTech LLC, 2019) </p>
					<p>As a result of the developments in areas of NLP, machine learning and artificial intelligence
						(AI) came the development of chatbots. A chatbot is essentially an automated conversational
						tool that is able to interact with users through text (for example, website chatbots) or
						speech (such as automated phone banking services, or interacting with Siri or Alexa) (Oracle
						2021). </p>
					<img id ="pimg" src="./img/AIchatbot.png" alt="How AI Chatbots Work" />
					<p>(Drift, n.d) </p>
					<p>Both NLP and chatbots use what are known as NLP tasks, where computers manipulate and
						translate language into information they can understand to produce a certain outcome (IBM
						Cloud Education 2020). Some of these basic, fundamental tasks are: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Speech recognition </li>
						<li>Speech tagging (also known as grammatical tagging) </li>
						<li>Word sense disambiguation </li>
						<li>Named entity recognition (NEM) </li>
						<li>Co-reference resolution </li>
						<li>Sentiment analysis, and </li>
						<li>Natural language generation </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Search engines and email filtering are some of the most common services where NLP is used.
						Both use combinations of NLP tasks to analyse large amounts of data from different sources
						to return results or sort messages based on filters selected by users. NLP has also been
						applied to speech recognition based, personal-assistant devices such as Amazon's Alexa and
						Apple's Siri, where users are able to interact with the device to complete various tasks
						using conversational, everyday language. </p>
					
					<p>Chatbots are now often the first point of contact for individuals in areas such as customer
						support and assistance. Many companies that provide goods and services, such as
						telecommunication providers or technology suppliers, usually provide a chatbot service on
						their websites or even in their call centres. </p>
					
					<p>NLP and chatbots are also used in areas such as the medical industry where large amounts of
						unstructured data sets are able to be analysed through machine learning algorithms to gain
						essential information for a variety of different reasons, such as determining where to
						direct future research or how to allocate resources, or gaining understanding of results
						from clinical trials (ForeSee Medical, Inc 2021). </p>
					
					<p>Despite the benefits of both NLP and chatbots in today's society, one main limitation has
						been the intricacies of languages. The first step performed by a chatbot is to extract from
						the input the relevant information (Expert.ai Team 2020). As there are so many combinations
						of words that a person may choose to use to request a particular function of a chatbot, the
						chatbot must sufficiently be able to extract the relevant input and understand what the user
						is attempting to achieve. If the chatbot is not able to understand what is being requested
						of them, there may be no action the chatbot can perform in response. However, with the
						progress made in the fields of NLP, AI and machine learning, chatbots are becoming more
						advanced, capable of providing a greater range of services. </p>

					<h3>What is the Likely Impact? </h3>
					<p>Natural language programming has already contributed greatly to society, with many new
						applications and services that have been developed. Most people would have interacted with
						chatbots in one form or another and with the progress being made in these related fields,
						the use of chatbots for not only individuals but also businesses will become more prevalent,
						such as context-sensitive digital assistants that are able to learn personal preferences and
						habits and are integrated with other programs (Lindquist 2018). </p>
					
					<p>One industry which may be impacted by improvements in NLP would be transcript, subtitle and
						closed-captioning services. Currently, these are mainly created through individuals
						reproducing what they think they can hear. Not only does this often result in inaccuracies,
						but also the process is time consuming and labour intensive. Though NLP has already led to
						various speech to text converters, for example, with autogenerated subtitles on YouTube,
						just as humans experience difficulties, the complexities of human language can also make it
						difficult for computers to accurately reproduce what has been said into a text format.
						Despite the limitations of both human efforts and NLP, it is clear that these two processes
						in combination may assist in terms of maximising production while decreasing time and
						effort, for example, by automating the speech to text conversion with humans undertaking a
						quality assurance role rather than manually creating the complete transcript. </p>
					
					<p>The use of chatbots as customer service assistants can be seen as having both a positive and
						a negative NLP impact on society. Service providers like banks and internet providers often
						use chatbots in order to collect initial information from users to directing inquiries to
						the relevant department. Using chatbots as the first contact enables streamlining of the
						customer service experience and higher service satisfaction for users by receiving
						information from the user before connecting to an agent and categorising and directing
						requests to the appropriate departments for faster responses (Makadia 2019). However, with
						more efficient and interactive chatbots entering the customer service areas previously
						reserved for individuals, there may be a corresponding decline in the number of persons
						employed in these positions. </p>
					
					<p>Overall, while there are positives and negatives to progress being made in the fields of NLP
						and chatbots, for many, the convenience provided by the devices and services developed will
						greatly improve their quality of life, completing tasks more efficiently and improving
						customer satisfaction through less human interaction. </p>

					<h3>How Will This Affect You? </h3>
					<p>In modern society, there are already many examples of natural language processing and
						chatbots being employed, from closed-captioning for live television or subtitles on videos
						which assists the hearing impaired to the interactive nature of AIs such as Siri and Alexa
						that has the potential to dramatically improve our quality of life. </p>
					<p>The benefits of using NLP in order to analyse large data sets has already been proven and in
						use in industries such as medical, retail and education, amongst others. In the medical
						industry in particular, the move towards things such as digitisation of patient records and
						audio recordings of consultations which can be automatically transcribed may result in
						better patient care where doctors and nurses are not engaging in time-consuming
						administrative actions and are instead able to improve quality of care by focusing on more
						important issues (McQuilkin 2020), with NLP‑based data mining able to collect and produce
						relevant information from various sources. </p>
					
					<p>The use of devices utilising NLP such as the Alexa voice support on the Amazon Firestick also
					        has great benefit in terms of allowing users to easily access content, particularly those
						who may be elderly or disabled by simply verbally asking these devices to complete an
						action. </p>
					
					<p>The prevalence of text-based and speech-based chatbots on a variety of different platforms
						has also had a major positive impact both in terms of individuals and businesses. While
						customers are receiving more targeted assistance and faster solutions to their issues,
						businesses are also able to save costs and increase efficiency by reallocating their labour
						force to perform higher order tasks that would be difficult for computers to complete. </p>


					<h2>Cloud Computing by Cristopher Ariel Castro Inostroza - S3923904</h2>

					<br></br>
					<h3>What does it do?</h3>

					<p>With internet access availability, the cloud allows the user entry to distinct types of
						data stored in the cloud through any chosen device, smartphone, laptop, tablet, etc. This
						technology also
						permits the user to work together with
						other users, making more accessible and more efficient time management and allowing working
						from home or
						away from the office.</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>Considering all the advantages cloud computing gives to businesses, flexibility would be one
						of the most influential and
						crucial parts of cloud computing success. The future for this emerging technology looks
						promissory, helping cutting costs in
						technology deployment, sometimes cutting even half of the total cost of companies. Cloud
						infrastructure allows different
						institutions to deploy any application globally in minutes with just a few clicks. This is a
						new way of delivery, and
						therefore new implementation and creation are updated in a brief time. For example, cooling
						systems are essential for
						physical cloud centres. It keeps the cloud’s hardware at a suitable working temperature.
						Nevertheless, cooling systems
						come with a prohibitive cost when building a physical clouds database. New colling systems
						models are being implemented
						and develop, being one of the latest: under the ocean cooling system
						by google cloud “Hamina,” one of the many data centres across the globe to handle the 40,000
						search queries a second. </p>
					<br></br>
					<p>Nowadays, you can easily choose diverse types of cloud services depending on your needs. We
						could have several types of
						cloud services such as:</p>
					<br></br>
					<h4>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>
					<p>PaaS takes away the task of managing the underlaying infrastructure (usually hardware and
						operating systems) and allows
						you to focus on the deployment and control of your applications. This helps to make you more
						efficient work as you don’t have
						to worry about resources attainment. “Capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or
						any of the other undifferentiated
						heavy lifting involved in running your application.” (Harvard EDX, 2021)
					</p>
					<h4>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
					<p>SaaS procures you with the complete package since the service provider arranges
						and manages the operations of your Cloud service. In most cases,
						“In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications” (Harvard
						EDX, 2021). With SaaS as a service, you
						only need to think
						about how to use that particular software. (Harvard EDX, 2021)</p>

                                         <h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices by Theodore Haluska- S3925389</h2>
					<br></br>
					<h3>What is it, and what does it do?</h3>
					<p>Small computing devices such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Makey Makey are known as SBCs
						(Single - Board Computer) with not only processing capabilities but have the potential for
						communication options through either onboard functions or additional modules that may be
						added such as Ethernet, Wireless, or Bluetooth. SBCs are manufactured to not only supply a
						cost-effective, compact design but a highly portable hardware solution. SBCs are not only an
						excellent choice for monitoring sensors or used in a remote setting, they are used in
						proto-typing, and due to the low cost of these devices, they are also used in education to
						provide young and old with the concepts of basic computer functions as well as programming.
					</p>
					<p>Below is an example of SBC sizes (although not limited):</p>
					<img id ="pimg" src="./img/SBC sizes.JPG" alt="Singleboard Computing Devices" />
					<p>Table 1.1 Role of Single Board Computers (SBCs) in rapid IoT Prototyping, by G. R.

					<br></br>
                                        <h2>Short explanations of Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Makey Makey</h2>
					<br></br>
					<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
					<p>Raspberry Pi has its own on-board RAM, CPU, Display ports, Ethernet port, USB ports for a
						start, it also uses an operating system such as Raspbian OS, Snappy Ubuntu Core, Ubuntu
						Mate, OSMC and LibreElec (Kodi-based media center), non-Linux based Risc OS, it can even run
						Windows 10 IoT Core (differs from a normal Windows 10 installation). These are the official
						operating systems that are listed for the device with countless others out there. Raspberry
						Pi’s operating system Raspbian OS uses Scratch to write and debug python code for your
						intended use by sending those commands to the GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which
						in turn you have your hardware connected to.</p>

					<h3>Arduino</h3>
					<p>Arduino is classified as a microcontroller (embedded controller, memory, peripherals,
						processor) and does not have an operating system, instead, you write the code and upload it
						straight to the board which leaves out the chance that a third-party application or
						operating system will interfere with the commands or code.</p>

					<h3>Makey Makey</h3>
					<p>Makey Makey is a simple device that lets the user use everyday objects as a keyboard or mouse
						input, you can create your own sensors, the idea is to get users to use their imagination
						when it comes to an invention or even out of the box thinking in everyday life and the main
						purpose is the education with the use of sensors and circuits. </p>
					<br></br>
					<p>SBCs are used in all forms of applications from education, industrial, software and hardware

					<br></br>
					<p>SBC’s will more than likely find their way into more commonly used products whether the user
						is aware or not. SBCs are becoming more AI friendly while traditionally AI has been sent to
						the cloud for processing, due to privacy concerns over the years these devices are evolving
						and have the capacity at least on a general level to possibly provide the AI calculations

					<br></br>
					<p>Advances in computer chips and what are called AI co-processors are taking what would take an

					<br></br>
					<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
					<p>The impact of these technologies is that they have to potential to automate certain aspects

					<br></br>
					<p>As SBCs technology evolves, becoming faster, smaller, more plug and play, the range of users

					<br></br>
					<p>The growing number of users educated in computer sciences also has the chance to affect the

					<br></br>
					<h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
					<p>The more individuals involved with SBCs and their development may affect daily life through
						several ways by increasing the creativity and potential to lead into new products. Let’s
						take the normal household chore of vacuuming or cleaning the floor, robot vacuums already
						exist and although they cannot navigate all obstacles or pick up items that had been left on
						your floor, they do a particularly decent job when it comes to daily cleaning at least for
						the floor leaving you to focus more on other tasks and events happening in your daily life.
						These robots use SBCs to navigate your home along with some form of AI to choose the
						appropriate route and mapping, the boundaries within the home, even remember obstacles, they
						even return to the dock to empty their canister and recharge when low on battery.</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>As far as my personal day to day life, SBCs have the ability to change my daily life by

                                                <h3>What is the Likely Impact?</h3>
						<p>With the future facing more threats due to the extant on technology has been available,
							Organizations must be smarter in how they protect their data. This is when the following
							methods come in place according to
							Navigating New Cyber Risks pp 125-135 Under Future Solitons written by Ganna Pogrebna & Mark
							Skilton. </p>

						<h4><u>Scenario Testing:</u></h4>
						<p>Organizations could simulate different attacks to understand the potential impact it could
							have on their business.
							By doing this, the data that was collected can be used to create a risk assessment and
							develop a risk management plain to try
							stop any future attacks. </p>

						<h4><u>Terraforming Cyberspace:</u></h4>
						<p> This exciting technology would be hard to get pass by.
							Terraforming would work by removing any possible human related risks such as human errors or
							abuse to the software and hardware.
							The technology would possible be ran by AI or quantum computing.
							Terraforming could be reality soon and this could eliminate the use of Cybersecurity
							analysts. </p>

						<h4><u>Cryptography of the Future:</u></h4>
						<p> With new developing technology fast approaching, using encryption will become obsolete.
							Other tools to help keep and manage passwords safe at the highest level of security will be
							the way of the future. </p>

						<h4><u>Zero-knowledge proofs:</u></h4>
						<p>defined as “a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the
							verifier) that something is true,
							without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true”
							If this vision is successfully adopted,
							it would be very use-full in levels which could protect people’s identity and privacy. </p>

						<h4><u>Mobile Targets:</u></h4>
						<p>An attack on a mobile which resulted in data breaches would require the Tech company to
							adjust all data that was attached and the toolbox as well.
							Instead of doing this, creating an index for the targeted phone would make it impossible for
							the hacker to do their job. </p>

						<h4><u>Algorithmic active Cyber defence:</u></h4>
						<p>This type of defence uses traps to help lure and capture any interruptions caused by hackers.
							This technology is already in place. The future for this technology will be more practice in
							systems in the future.
							The traps would be well calculated that it would be more effective in capturing,
							diagnostics, and even future threats.</p>
						<p>The future of Cybersecurity looks strong. Having this possible innovative technology to fight
							cybercrime would be harder for any breaches to occur.
							However, the impact in having them in place could cost jobs.
							It would replace an entire range of cyber jobs because it would be less human interactive
							because majority would be algorithm controlled. </p>

                                                <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
						<p> Growing up in the early 90’s and the 2000’s and see the advancement of technology was so
							excited I could not get enough of it.
							I remember the diel up internet which I thought was the bees’ knees. Playing games and
							chatting to friends on MSN and IQ after school while doing homework was fun.
							I do not recall anything about security, except for a Firewall and Anti-Virus software. Back
							then, I did not know what that was out there could harm the computer. </p>
						<p> After doing this research, I have learnt a lot of dangerous software in the cyber web that
							could do lots of damage that I was not aware of existence.
							This is a real revelation, not just for myself but for my family and friends as well.</p>
						<p> With technology advancing each year, more dangerous the world wide web will become.
							Having a 5-year-old with iPad is concerning because they access the web.
							I rely on Apple’s security system to keep the iPad safe from harmful things. Sure, I could
							just monitor the usage, but I cannot be there 24/7.
							If the iPad were compromised, my phone could be next due to the linking of Apple products.
						</p>
						<p>Seeing new software emerge in the market is a good sign we will be protected from outside
							interference.
							Having products with the latest security features such as fingerprinting, and face
							recognition software installed is a wonderful thing.
							Not only it will stop unauthorized access but also protecting all our information and all
							passwords.
							However, the fingerprint scanning can be time consuming because sometimes and it fail then
							you need to go through the process of putting your passwords in.</p>
						<p> Looking into the future, I feel at ease for my growing family. My kids will have one of the
							strongest security systems in the world working before they understand about all this. But
							having all this security still does not stop online behaviour such as bullying.
							We should investigate software that detects unwanted behaviour so we could stamp it out
							completely. </p>

                                                <h2>Natural Language Processing and Chatbots By Nicole Attard - S3924819</h2>
						<h3>What does it do?</h3>
						<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence which refers to the
							use of computational techniques to "learn, understand and produce human language content"
							(Hirschberg & Manning 2015). In other words, a computer will receive input from a user,
							either in a written or oral form, gain an understanding of the content and then respond
							appropriately. Given the complexities of human language, especially with verbal
							communication, NLP combines "statistical, machine learning and deep learning models" (IBM
							Cloud Education 2020) in order to derive meaning and provide the desired outcome. </p>
						<p>Machine learning is a key element of natural language processing. By providing learning
							algorithms with large amounts of data relating to languages, the computer is able to learn
							more effectively how to identify the intent, categorise the request and respond in a
							conversational format (IBM Cloud Education 2020). </p>
						<img src="./img/nlp.png" alt="How Natural Language Processing Works" />
						<p>(AthenaTech LLC, 2019) </p>
						<p>As a result of the developments in areas of NLP, machine learning and artificial intelligence
							(AI) came the development of chatbots. A chatbot is essentially an automated conversational
							tool that is able to interact with users through text (for example, website chatbots) or
							speech (such as automated phone banking services, or interacting with Siri or Alexa) (Oracle
							2021). </p>
						<img id ="pimg" src="./img/AIchatbot.png" alt="How AI Chatbots Work" />
						<p>(Drift, n.d) </p>
						<p>Both NLP and chatbots use what are known as NLP tasks, where computers manipulate and
							translate language into information they can understand to produce a certain outcome (IBM
							Cloud Education 2020). Some of these basic, fundamental tasks are: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Speech recognition </li>
							<li>Speech tagging (also known as grammatical tagging) </li>
							<li>Word sense disambiguation </li>
							<li>Named entity recognition (NEM) </li>
							<li>Co-reference resolution </li>
							<li>Sentiment analysis, and </li>
							<li>Natural language generation </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Search engines and email filtering are some of the most common services where NLP is used.
							Both use combinations of NLP tasks to analyse large amounts of data from different sources
							to return results or sort messages based on filters selected by users. NLP has also been
							applied to speech recognition based, personal-assistant devices such as Amazon's Alexa and
							Apple's Siri, where users are able to interact with the device to complete various tasks
							using conversational, everyday language. </p>
						<p>Chatbots are now often the first point of contact for individuals in areas such as customer
							support and assistance. Many companies that provide goods and services, such as
							telecommunication providers or technology suppliers, usually provide a chatbot service on
							their websites or even in their call centres. </p>
						<p>NLP and chatbots are also used in areas such as the medical industry where large amounts of
							unstructured data sets are able to be analysed through machine learning algorithms to gain
							essential information for a variety of different reasons, such as determining where to
							direct future research or how to allocate resources, or gaining understanding of results
							from clinical trials (ForeSee Medical, Inc 2021). </p>
						<p>Despite the benefits of both NLP and chatbots in today's society, one main limitation has
							been the intricacies of languages. The first step performed by a chatbot is to extract from
							the input the relevant information (Expert.ai Team 2020). As there are so many combinations
							of words that a person may choose to use to request a particular function of a chatbot, the
							chatbot must sufficiently be able to extract the relevant input and understand what the user
							is attempting to achieve. If the chatbot is not able to understand what is being requested
							of them, there may be no action the chatbot can perform in response. However, with the
							progress made in the fields of NLP, AI and machine learning, chatbots are becoming more
							advanced, capable of providing a greater range of services. </p>

						<h3>What is the Likely Impact? </h3>
						<p>Natural language programming has already contributed greatly to society, with many new
							applications and services that have been developed. Most people would have interacted with
							chatbots in one form or another and with the progress being made in these related fields,
							the use of chatbots for not only individuals but also businesses will become more prevalent,
							such as context-sensitive digital assistants that are able to learn personal preferences and
							habits and are integrated with other programs (Lindquist 2018). </p>
						<p>One industry which may be impacted by improvements in NLP would be transcript, subtitle and
							closed-captioning services. Currently, these are mainly created through individuals
							reproducing what they think they can hear. Not only does this often result in inaccuracies,
							but also the process is time consuming and labour intensive. Though NLP has already led to
							various speech to text converters, for example, with autogenerated subtitles on YouTube,
							just as humans experience difficulties, the complexities of human language can also make it
							difficult for computers to accurately reproduce what has been said into a text format.
							Despite the limitations of both human efforts and NLP, it is clear that these two processes
							in combination may assist in terms of maximising production while decreasing time and
							effort, for example, by automating the speech to text conversion with humans undertaking a
							quality assurance role rather than manually creating the complete transcript. </p>
						<p>The use of chatbots as customer service assistants can be seen as having both a positive and
							a negative NLP impact on society. Service providers like banks and internet providers often
							use chatbots in order to collect initial information from users to directing inquiries to
							the relevant department. Using chatbots as the first contact enables streamlining of the
							customer service experience and higher service satisfaction for users by receiving
							information from the user before connecting to an agent and categorising and directing
							requests to the appropriate departments for faster responses (Makadia 2019). However, with
							more efficient and interactive chatbots entering the customer service areas previously
							reserved for individuals, there may be a corresponding decline in the number of persons
							employed in these positions. </p>
						<p>Overall, while there are positives and negatives to progress being made in the fields of NLP
							and chatbots, for many, the convenience provided by the devices and services developed will
							greatly improve their quality of life, completing tasks more efficiently and improving
							customer satisfaction through less human interaction. </p>

						<h3>How Will This Affect You? </h3>
						<p>In modern society, there are already many examples of natural language processing and
							chatbots being employed, from closed-captioning for live television or subtitles on videos
							which assists the hearing impaired to the interactive nature of AIs such as Siri and Alexa
							that has the potential to dramatically improve our quality of life. </p>
						<p>The benefits of using NLP in order to analyse large data sets has already been proven and in
							use in industries such as medical, retail and education, amongst others. In the medical
							industry in particular, the move towards things such as digitisation of patient records and
							audio recordings of consultations which can be automatically transcribed may result in
							better patient care where doctors and nurses are not engaging in time-consuming
							administrative actions and are instead able to improve quality of care by focusing on more
							important issues (McQuilkin 2020), with NLP‑based data mining able to collect and produce
							relevant information from various sources. </p>
						<p>The use of devices utilising NLP such as the Alexa voice support on the Amazon Firestick also
							has great benefit in terms of allowing users to easily access content, particularly those
							who may be elderly or disabled by simply verbally asking these devices to complete an
							action. </p>
						<p>The prevalence of text-based and speech-based chatbots on a variety of different platforms
							has also had a major positive impact both in terms of individuals and businesses. While
							customers are receiving more targeted assistance and faster solutions to their issues,
							businesses are also able to save costs and increase efficiency by reallocating their labour
							force to perform higher order tasks that would be difficult for computers to complete. </p>
                               
					        <h2>Cloud Computing by Cristopher Ariel Castro Inostroza - S3923904</h2>
					        <br></br>
						<h3>What does it do?</h3>

						<p>With internet access availability, the cloud allows the user entry to distinct types of
							data stored in the cloud through any chosen device, smartphone, laptop, tablet, etc. This
							technology also
							permits the user to work together with
							other users, making more accessible and more efficient time management and allowing working
							from home or
							away from the office.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>Considering all the advantages cloud computing gives to businesses, flexibility would be one
							of the most influential and
							crucial parts of cloud computing success. The future for this emerging technology looks
							promissory, helping cutting costs in
							technology deployment, sometimes cutting even half of the total cost of companies. Cloud
							infrastructure allows different
							institutions to deploy any application globally in minutes with just a few clicks. This is a
							new way of delivery, and
							therefore new implementation and creation are updated in a brief time. For example, cooling
							systems are essential for
							physical cloud centres. It keeps the cloud’s hardware at a suitable working temperature.
							Nevertheless, cooling systems
							come with a prohibitive cost when building a physical clouds database. New colling systems
							models are being implemented
							and develop, being one of the latest: under the ocean cooling system
							by google cloud “Hamina,” one of the many data centres across the globe to handle the 40,000
							search queries a second. </p>
						<br></br>
						<p>Nowadays, you can easily choose diverse types of cloud services depending on your needs. We
							could have several types of
							cloud services such as:</p>
						<br></br>
						<h4>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>
						<p>PaaS takes away the task of managing the underlaying infrastructure (usually hardware and
							operating systems) and allows
							you to focus on the deployment and control of your applications. This helps to make you more
							efficient work as you don’t have
							to worry about resources attainment. “Capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or
							any of the other undifferentiated
							heavy lifting involved in running your application.” (Harvard EDX, 2021)
						</p>
						<h4>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
						<p>SaaS procures you with the complete package since the service provider arranges
							and manages the operations of your Cloud service. In most cases,
							“In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications” (Harvard
							EDX, 2021). With SaaS as a service, you
							only need to think
							about how to use that particular software. (Harvard EDX, 2021)</p>


						<h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices by Theodore Haluska- S3925389</h2>
						<br></br>
						<h3>What is it, and what does it do?</h3>
						<p>Small computing devices such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Makey Makey are known as SBCs
							(Single - Board Computer) with not only processing capabilities but have the potential for
							communication options through either onboard functions or additional modules that may be
							added such as Ethernet, Wireless, or Bluetooth. SBCs are manufactured to not only supply a
							cost-effective, compact design but a highly portable hardware solution. SBCs are not only an
							excellent choice for monitoring sensors or used in a remote setting, they are used in
							proto-typing, and due to the low cost of these devices, they are also used in education to
							provide young and old with the concepts of basic computer functions as well as programming.
						</p>
						<p>Below is an example of SBC sizes (although not limited):</p>

						<br></br>
						<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
						<p>Raspberry Pi has its own on-board RAM, CPU, Display ports, Ethernet port, USB ports for a
							start, it also uses an operating system such as Raspbian OS, Snappy Ubuntu Core, Ubuntu
							Mate, OSMC and LibreElec (Kodi-based media center), non-Linux based Risc OS, it can even run
							Windows 10 IoT Core (differs from a normal Windows 10 installation). These are the official
							operating systems that are listed for the device with countless others out there. Raspberry
							Pi’s operating system Raspbian OS uses Scratch to write and debug python code for your
							intended use by sending those commands to the GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which
							in turn you have your hardware connected to.</p>

						<h3>Arduino</h3>
						<p>Arduino is classified as a microcontroller (embedded controller, memory, peripherals,
							processor) and does not have an operating system, instead, you write the code and upload it
							straight to the board which leaves out the chance that a third-party application or
							operating system will interfere with the commands or code.</p>
						<br></br>
						<h3>Makey Makey</h3>
						<p>Makey Makey is a simple device that lets the user use everyday objects as a keyboard or mouse
							input, you can create your own sensors, the idea is to get users to use their imagination
							when it comes to an invention or even out of the box thinking in everyday life and the main
							purpose is the education with the use of sensors and circuits. </p>
						<br></br>
						<p>SBCs are used in all forms of applications from education, industrial, software and hardware

							SBC a long time to generate a result though AI to a more consistent and efficient time when
							comparing the original time it takes the SBC to do the calculations to say a Cloud-based

						<br></br>
						<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
						<p>The impact of these technologies is that they have to potential to automate certain aspects

							identify our strengths and weaknesses, making sure no one is left behind when meeting
							through Microsoft video
							Teams. It also made me more confident and gave me an awesome feeling that working with
							others can be an enjoyable experience.
							Effective communication was essential to
							carry out this assessment. Each one of us has a unique skill that makes us who we are. </h3>
						<br></br>
						<h4>Challenges </h4>
						<p> The challenge is to put each other’s work together, to make it fit between each other’s
							ideas or frames of what is
							presentable, but in the end, we could agree on having different perspectives and have a
							great assessment delivery. </p>
						<br></br>
						<h4>Benefits</h4>
						<p>Get to know different opinions from my own and to realize that working in groups is a lot of
							fun</p>
						<br></br>
						<h4>What will I do next time?</h4>
						<p> It depends on the types of people we are doing the group work. I would use Microsoft Teams
							and GitHub again definitely.
							Pleasant experience overall and great teamwork! </p>

						<p> It must have been God’s will that I am belong to this group, “The Conquerors”. 

My teammates, consist of young skilful and talented individual who are all hungry for learnings and experiences. Our TeamWorks is amazing, we have a natural born leader who organizes our regular meetings thru Microsoft Teams, patiently making meeting’s agenda and recordings. Volunteers, who despite of busy schedule at work are willing to spend time and contribute their knowledge and skills for the success of this project. 

The challenges we faced for this project is the availability of everyone, thru time differences, workloads, other personal situations and lockdowns we were able to cope up and now we are on the finishing stage. There are also some technical difficulties such as using Teams and Github. I for example, considered myself as a novice for this project cannot make it without the help and support of my teammates. I constantly message them and ask for help and information specially on the technical side of it.  

Perhaps the one thing that I learned working in a group is to value the time and effort that everyone contributed to make this project a successful one. You cannot put a price on anyone's passion to make this happen. The camaraderie and respect despite just working together for about 3 weeks. The confidence developed that despite all things we can make it happen.
