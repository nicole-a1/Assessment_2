                                               <h2 id="gpp">GROUP PERSONALITY PROFILES </h2>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Myers-Briggs Test Results</h2>
                        <img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-myers-briggs.png" alt="team myers briggs 1" />
			<br></br>
			<img  id ="pimg" src="./img/team-myers-briggs-personality-test2.png" alt="team myers briggs 2" />
			<br></br>
			<p>The Myers-Briggs personality test attempts to categorise the personalities of individuals into one of 16
				different types based on the theories of Carl G Jung (The Myers & Briggs Foundation 2021). Though this
				particular test has been found to be practically meaningless, it is still commonly used in the workplace
				and
				in educational institutions as a way to analyse the abilities or personal profiles of individuals
				(Strombert and Caswell 2015). </p>
			<br></br>
			<p>Having each taken the Myers-Briggs test though as a way to get to know each other as a team, the results
				have been complied
				in the graphs above. It can clearly be seen that the group is made up of individuals with very different
				personalities.
				Despite this, the results would indicate that while there are varying tendencies, they appear to be
				quite moderate, with the
				majority of traits being represented as a balance between two extremes for most of the team.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>A team comprised of individuals with different profiles, especially when considering these profiles tend
				to be in the
				moderate range of between 30 to 80% is extremely beneficial. In a setting such as this where a team is
				working in the IT
				field, the lack of extremes in traits such as being intuitive/observant or thinking/feeling would
				minimise the extent to
				which disagreements and issues arise with individuals at opposites ends of the scale. Also, for those
				individuals with extreme
				tendencies (for example, introversion or assertiveness) would be tempered by the personalities of the
				other members of the group,
				hopefully enabling the team to work effectively and efficiently together to progress towards a common
				goal.</p>
                                                   <h2>Big-Five visual Team Test Results </h2>
			<br></br>
			<img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-big-five-personality-test.png" alt="team big five" />
			<br></br>
			<p>The Big Five personality test aims to provide a statistical result in relation to a series of questions
				relating to five personality traits being: extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness,
				conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. From the above graph, we can see that the group is made up
				of individuals with very different profiles. There is a wide range of results for all categories.</p>
			<p>The differences in all these traits will hopefully contribute to a balanced group dynamic where different
				ideas are able to be brought to the table and different approaches to working will help to keep the
				project moving forward and on track. For example, the differences in the intellect/imagination traits
				will enable effective discussions in relation to conventional versus more imaginative ideas and
				approaches and may provide unique perspectives as the group works to a common goal. </p>
			<p>Though there are some extreme differences, such as across the extroversion and intellect/imagination
				traits, the consistent levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness across the group is likely to help
				lessen the impacts of any disagreements that may arise, and provides an environment where each team
				member can contribute effectively. </p>
			<br></br>
                                            <h2>The VARK Questionnaire Visual Team Test Results </h2>
			<br></br>
			<img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-vark-questionnaire.png" alt="team vark" />
			<p>Throughout the years, many studies have been conducted around the validity and accuracy of learning style
				assessments. While the majority of these studies have found that knowing a person's preferred manner of
				learning (visual, auditory, text or practical based) does not help them learn more effectively by
				tailoring learning styles to suit individuals, they are still widely used as an assessment tool in
				educational institutions today (Reynolds 2021). </p>
			<p>Having each conducted the VARK learning test, we can clearly see in the above graph that while it appears
				that kinesthetic is the preferred method of learning for the group, all other modes of learning are
				still represented. This would indicate a team that would be able to process and share information in a
				variety of ways to ensure the group is able to effectively work together towards a common goal.</p>

                        <h4>Future Team’s Job titles in demand:</h4><br>
				        <img id ="pimg" src="./img/team-ideal-jobs-demand.png" alt="team's ideal jobs in demand" /><br>
				        As a group, there is a variety of ideal jobs, each having a different focus in the IT
                        industry. From the above graph, it is clear that by far, the most in demand job is for
				        cybersecurity analysts. This is also reflected in the fact that the ideal jobs of two
				        members of a team of six is cybersecurity analyst. With the increase in the use of online
				        services, it is obvious that security is going to play a major role in the future as more of
				        our personal and sensitive information is uploaded onto the internet in particular, thus
				        fuelling the demand to protect this data. By 2026, it is predicted that there will be an
				        additional 17,600 jobs for cybersecurity analysts.
						The next highest demand is in relation to cloud architects. The reasons for the demand for
				        cybersecurity analysts can also be seen to be contributing factors in the demand for cloud
				        architects. From 2018 to 2021, there has been an 11% increase in self-identified cloud
				        architects. No doubt this figure will continue to rise as more industries take advantage of
				        developments in this field, moving their operations to the cloud to reduce their costs and
				        increase efficiency, with further benefits in choice, scalability, speed, integration,
				        auditing and compliance, and business continuity planning (Saint-Marc 2014).
						Next in demand is DevOps, with expectations of around 30% growth by 2025. Similar to the
				        growth in demand for cybersecurity analysts and cloud architects, the increasing use of
				        software and developments in IT technologies and the fact that many businesses are now
				        moving much of their process into the cloud has contributed greatly to the demand for DevOps
				        engineers, especially in terms of facilitating effective collaboration between software
				        development and IT teams (DevopsCurry 2020).
						Software quality assurance engineers are next in demand. So far they appear to have a small
				        presence in the industry with only 640 persons employed in this role in 2016 in Australia,
				        but would appear to have strong growth outcomes, reaching levels of 34% growth by 2025. Like
				        all the ideal jobs described previously, developments and improvements in terms of software
				        will require software quality assurance engineers to ensure that the end product provides
				        the desired outcome.
						Finally, though it seems to have the smallest demand, growth in the ICT support technician
				        field is expected to increase from 65,800 in 2018 to 77,900 by 2023. As with all other IT
				        positions, the increase in the number of people accessing and using IT technologies will
				        lead to the requirement for consistent and ongoing support. ICT support technicians are
				        often the first point of contact for end users to provide technical support and assistance
				        for users of computer infrastructure and web technologies.
						Though there are differences in terms of job roles and technical skills required for each
				        job, people employed in these positions often work as a team in order to provide services to
				        the consumer. For example, when working on a particular project involving cloud
				        architecture, obviously a cloud architect would be required to head the project, designing
				        the architecture to suit the client's instructions. DevOps would be involved to ensure the
				        appropriate software and technologies are being utilised, while software engineering
				        analysts are needed to ensure the technologies utilised work correctly for the client.
				        Cybersecurity analysts and IT support technicians would likely be involved in the ongoing
				        support and security for the clients and other end users (Sheehy 2019).

					<article>
						<h2 id="iwip">By Sharif Ayazi and Michael Sy</h2>
						<p>
							Appendix A With this, we interviewed Mr. Chris Televantos, 29 years of age. An IT
							professional currently working as a customer field services officer for Financial Services
							Solutions Corp. He started his passion for IT when he is 16 years old, influenced by his
							uncle (who owns a Telstra licensee store.) and continue to pursue it by studying at Boxhill
							Institute of TAFE and took up Advance Diploma of Computer System Engineering. From then on,
							He worked from various IT related industries. His day to day job involves troubleshooting
							and diagnosing network related issues. His clients mostly from banking and retail doing
							technical diagnosis of ATM machines dealing with the complexity of electromechanical devices
							that runs thru windows which often resulting to some issues like IP problem and defective
							components as far as drivers' issues and firmware. In terms of communication, he is
							constantly interacting with his colleagues and superiors specially for some problems and
							situations that needed an escalation to a higher level of skills and authority. The
							challenging part of his work is having a time constraint for a particular task and the SLA
							agreement.Perhaps, the best input that I learned with my conversation with Chris is that IT
							is one of the fastest growing industry now and the demand for IT skilled people are so
							in-demand particularly in cyber security and cloud computing. The skills needed are also
							constantly changing and evolving due to a substantial risk of cyber security and
							competitions among giants in IT world. That is why an IT person should continue to study and
							keep updating his knowledge and skills to be able to cope with all the updates and

					<h2>CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
                    <h2>By Cristopher Ariel Castro Inostroza S3923904</h2>
                    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        With internet access availability, the cloud allows the user entry to distinct types of data stored in the cloud through any chosen device, smartphone, laptop, tablet, etc. This technology also permits the user to work together with other users, making more accessible and more efficient time management and allowing working from home or away from the office.Considering all the advantages cloud computing gives to businesses, flexibility would be one of the most influential and crucial parts of cloud computing success. The future for this emerging technology looks promissory, helping cutting costs in technology deployment, sometimes cutting even half of the total cost of companies. Cloud infrastructure allows different institutions to deploy any application globally in minutes with just a few clicks. This is a new way of delivery, and therefore new implementation and creation are updated in a brief time. For example, cooling systems are essential for physical cloud centres. It keeps the cloud’s hardware at a suitable working temperature. Nevertheless, cooling systems come with a prohibitive cost when building a physical clouds database. New colling systems models are being implemented and develop, being one of the latest: under the ocean cooling system by google cloud “Hamina,” one of the many data centres across the globe to handle the 40,000 search queries a second. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        PaaS takes away the task of managing the underlaying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and control of your applications. This helps to make you more efficient work as you don’t have to worry about resources attainment. “Capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.” (Harvard EDX, 2021)
                    </p>
                    <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        SaaS procures you with the complete package since the service provider arranges and manages the operations of your Cloud service. In most cases, “In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications” (Harvard EDX, 2021). With SaaS as a service, you only need to think about how to use that particular software. (Harvard EDX, 2021)
                    </p>
                    <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (LaaS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        LaaS carries the foundation blocks for cloud IT. Typically grants you access to networking features, computer (dedicated hardware or on virtual), and data storage. LaaS provides you with almost full flexibility and management control over your IT resources. “It is most like the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar.” (Harvard EDX, 2021).

                    <p>An organization usually moves to cloud services due to its benefits, such as increased agility, reduced cost, elasticity, DevOps friendly, and improved time. On         average, organizations are finding that clouds meet these expectations or even exceeding them

                    <p>(2021, survey “Cloud alliance”)</p>
                    <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The use of cloud services has been increasing over the past decade. Especially in the wake of the COVID-19 health crisis, plenty of companies are accelerating their cloud implementation in their services to enable employees to work from home. Furthermore, people and organizations have been positively impacted by cloud services. Now not only can you access important files, but also you can have all your most dearly information on just one click away.Plenty of companies and organizations are running 41% or even more of their workloads in clouds. This digitalization from standard company systems to cloud platforms has grown exponentially since 2019. This article also suggests that 25% of organizations were running 41% or more of their workload in a public Cloud. The last recent survey by “Cloud Alliance, 2021” indicates that 63% of respondents expect to be running 41% or more of their workload in a public Cloud, pointing to a trending public Cloud usage that will only keep growing. Due to the recent health crisis, remote working has become important for many organizations encouraging the use of Cloud computing and complex system involving the process of adapting this technology. Another survey done in 2020 by CSA shows an increase in diversity of production workloads (e.g., container platforms, virtual machines) which, is also expected to increase. All this combined, plus the growing remote workforce, and the cloud computing environment continues emerging with more advances in its complexity. Inevitably, soon additional security tools will have to improve, to protect the demand and the threats in Cloud platforms. (2021, “Cloud Alliance”).

                    <p>
                        “Due to demand many companies have come up offering cloud computing to the private and public sectors being the dominant AWS by amazon, used by 67% of organizations and Azure a close second at 65%, most of the organization are also using multi-cloud strategy (62%) with 27% using three or more public cloud platforms”. (2021,” cloud alliance”)The usage percentage shows how cloud computing is changing the way businesses are and daily life in general. The potential impact could drastically change the way we live. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                    <p>On average, the highest-ranked security concerned was “sensitive data leakage” in a professional environment. We could see the following:</p>

                        “It is worth noting that the second and fourth most selected responses are both related to issues with staff, with a combined total of 79% surpassing the most frequently selected response “network security””. (2021, Cloud alliance) Cloud computing comes together with virtualization and enables us to live in a constant dependency on this technology. It connects us in a way never seen before allows work more efficiently. You can share files or any type of documents with a person across the globe, deploying an application in mere seconds.

                    <h2>RASPBERRY PIS, ARDUINOS, MAKEY MAKEYS AND OTHER SMALL COMPUTING DEVICES</h2>
                    <h2>By Theodore Haluska S3925389</h2>
                    <h3>What is it, and what does it do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Small computing devices such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Makey Makey are known as SBCs (Single - Board Computer) with not only processing capabilities but have the potential for communication options through either onboard functions or additional modules that may be added such as Ethernet, Wireless, or Bluetooth. SBCs are manufactured to not only supply a cost-effective, compact design but a highly portable hardware solution. SBCs are not only an excellent choice for monitoring sensors or used in a remote setting, they are used in proto-typing, and due to the low cost of these devices, they are also used in education to provide young and old with the concepts of basic computer functions as well as programming. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Below is an example of SBC sizes (although not limited):</p>
                    <p><img id ="pimg" src="./img/#" alt="Cloud alliance" /></p>
                    <p>Table 1.1 Role of Single Board Computers (SBCs) in rapid IoT Prototyping, by G. R. Kanagachidambaresan</p>
                    <h3>Short explanations of Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Makey Makey</h3>
                    <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
                    <p>
                        Raspberry Pi has its own on-board RAM, CPU, Display ports, Ethernet port, USB ports for a start, it also uses an operating system such as Raspbian OS, Snappy Ubuntu Core, Ubuntu Mate, OSMC and LibreElec (Kodi-based media center), non-Linux based Risc OS, it can even run Windows 10 IoT Core (differs from a normal Windows 10 installation). These are the official operating systems that are listed for the device with countless others out there. Raspberry Pi’s operating system Raspbian OS uses Scratch to write and debug python code for your intended use by sending those commands to the GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which in turn you have your hardware connected to.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Arduino</h3>
                    <p>
                        Arduino is classified as a microcontroller (embedded controller, memory, peripherals, processor) and does not have an operating system, instead, you write the code and upload it straight to the board which leaves out the chance that a third-party application or operating system will interfere with the commands or code
                    </p>
                    <h3>Makey Makey</h3>
                    <p>
                        Makey Makey is a simple device that lets the user use everyday objects as a keyboard or mouse input, you can create your own sensors, the idea is to get users to use their imagination when it comes to an invention or even out of the box thinking in everyday life and the main purpose is the education with the use of sensors and circuits.SBCs are used in all forms of applications from education, industrial, software and hardware development, scientific applications such as weather balloons, and even robotics. They supply necessary systems at a low power advantage to otherwise power-hungry traditional computers.SBC’s will more than likely find their way into more commonly used products whether the user is aware or not. SBCs are becoming more AI friendly while traditionally AI has been sent to the cloud for processing, due to privacy concerns over the years these devices are evolving and have the capacity at least on a general level to possibly provide the AI calculations locally instead of remotely.Advances in computer chips and what are called AI co-processors are taking what would take an SBC a long time to generate a result though AI to a more consistent and efficient time when comparing the original time it takes the SBC to do the calculations to say a Cloud-based system. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The impact of these technologies is that they have to potential to automate certain aspects of a job which some may argue this will create job losses. While this may be true in some form or another, it can also create new positions, if we use the example of automobiles, this forced carriage makers out of business, while also creating a new field of work for autobody makers.As SBCs technology evolves, becoming faster, smaller, more plug and play, the range of users increase leaving the potential for much bigger audience as well as their applications in everyday devices we use from a workplace setting to more personal at home.The growing number of users educated in computer sciences also has the chance to affect the number of job seekers increasing competition for positions such as in programming. SBCs can streamline or automate some processes and potentially make some workers redundant although this does not affect all industries instead SBCs may also take the workload off those employees so that they may focus more on the critical aspects of the job rather than some of the minor details. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The more individuals involved with SBCs and their development may affect daily life through several ways by increasing the creativity and potential to lead into new products. Let’s take the normal household chore of vacuuming or cleaning the floor, robot vacuums already exist and although they cannot navigate all obstacles or pick up items that had been left on your floor, they do a particularly decent job when it comes to daily cleaning at least for the floor leaving you to focus more on other tasks and events happening in your daily life. These robots use SBCs to navigate your home along with some form of AI to choose the appropriate route and mapping, the boundaries within the home, even remember obstacles, they even return to the dock to empty their canister and recharge when low on battery.As far as my personal day to day life, SBCs have the ability to change my daily life by making me more efficient at more important tasks whether it be at work or home, the age of technology although the benefits have also created more work for the average user and through the use of SBCs we may be able to cutback the reliance on certain aspects of our lives so we may enjoy it more.

                    <h2>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND CHATTERBOTS</h2>
                    <h2>By Nicole Attard s3924819</h2>
                    <h3>What Does It Do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence which refers to the use of computational techniques to "learn, understand and produce human language content" (Hirschberg & Manning 2015). In other words, a computer will receive input from a user, either in a written or oral form, gain an understanding of the content and then respond appropriately. Given the complexities of human language, especially with verbal communication, NLP combines "statistical, machine learning and deep learning models" (IBM Cloud Education 2020) in order to derive meaning and provide the desired outcome.Machine learning is a key element of natural language processing. By providing learning algorithms with large amounts of data relating to languages, the computer is able to learn more effectively how to identify the intent, categorise the request and respond in a conversational format (IBM Cloud Education 2020).

                    <p>
                        As a result of the developments in areas of NLP, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) came the development of chatbots. A chatbot is essentially an   automated conversational tool that is able to interact with users through text (for example, website chatbots) or speech (such as automated phone banking services,   or interacting with Siri or Alexa) (Oracle 2021).
                    </p>

                    <p>(Drift, n.d)</p>
                    <p>
                        Both NLP and chatbots use what are known as NLP tasks, where computers manipulate and translate language into information they can understand to produce a certain outcome (IBM Cloud Education 2020). Some of these basic, fundamental tasks are: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speech recognition </li>
                        <li>Speech tagging (also known as grammatical tagging) </li>
                        <li>Word sense disambiguation </li>
                        <li>Named entity recognition (NEM) </li>
                        <li>Co-reference resolution </li>
                        <li>Sentiment analysis, and </li>
                        <li>Natural language generation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Search engines and email filtering are some of the most common services where NLP is used. Both use combinations of NLP tasks to analyse large amounts of data from different sources to return results or sort messages based on filters selected by users. NLP has also been applied to speech recognition based, personal-assistant devices such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, where users are able to interact with the device to complete various tasks using conversational, everyday language.Chatbots are now often the first point of contact for individuals in areas such as customer support and assistance. Many companies that provide goods and services, such as telecommunication providers or technology suppliers, usually provide a chatbot service on their websites or even in their call centres.NLP and chatbots are also used in areas such as the medical industry where large amounts of unstructured data sets are able to be analysed through machine learning algorithms to gain essential information for a variety of different reasons, such as determining where to direct future research or how to allocate resources, or gaining understanding of results from clinical trials (ForeSee Medical, Inc 2021).Despite the benefits of both NLP and chatbots in today's society, one main limitation has been the intricacies of languages. The first step performed by a chatbot is to extract from the input the relevant information (Expert.ai Team 2020). As there are so many combinations of words that a person may choose to use to request a particular function of a chatbot, the chatbot must sufficiently be able to extract the relevant input and understand what the user is attempting to achieve. If the chatbot is not able to understand what is being requested of them, there may be no action the chatbot can perform in response. However, with the progress made in the fields of NLP, AI and machine learning, chatbots are becoming more advanced, capable of providing a greater range of services.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the Likely Impact? </h3>
                    <p>
                        Natural language programming has already contributed greatly to society, with many new applications and services that have been developed. Most people would have interacted with chatbots in one form or another and with the progress being made in these related fields, the use of chatbots for not only individuals but also businesses will become more prevalent, such as context-sensitive digital assistants that are able to learn personal preferences and habits and are integrated with other programs (Lindquist 2018).One industry which may be impacted by improvements in NLP would be transcript, subtitle and closed-captioning services. Currently, these are mainly created through individuals reproducing what they think they can hear. Not only does this often result in inaccuracies, but also the process is time consuming and labour intensive. Though NLP has already led to various speech to text converters, for example, with autogenerated subtitles on YouTube, just as humans experience difficulties, the complexities of human language can also make it difficult for computers to accurately reproduce what has been said into a text format. Despite the limitations of both human efforts and NLP, it is clear that these two processes in combination may assist in terms of maximising production while decreasing time and effort, for example, by automating the speech to text conversion with humans undertaking a quality assurance role rather than manually creating the complete transcript.The use of chatbots as customer service assistants can be seen as having both a positive and a negative NLP impact on society. Service providers like banks and internet providers often use chatbots in order to collect initial information from users to directing inquiries to the relevant department. Using chatbots as the first contact enables streamlining of the customer service experience and higher service satisfaction for users by receiving information from the user before connecting to an agent and categorising and directing requests to the appropriate departments for faster responses (Makadia 2019). However, with more efficient and interactive chatbots entering the customer service areas previously reserved for individuals, there may be a corresponding decline in the number of persons employed in these positions.Overall, while there are positives and negatives to progress being made in the fields of NLP and chatbots, for many, the convenience provided by the devices and services developed will greatly improve their quality of life, completing tasks more efficiently and improving customer satisfaction through less human interaction. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>How Will This Affect You?  </h3>
                    <p>
                        In modern society, there are already many examples of natural language processing and chatbots being employed, from closed-captioning for live television or subtitles on videos which assists the hearing impaired to the interactive nature of AIs such as Siri and Alexa that has the potential to dramatically improve our quality of life.The benefits of using NLP in order to analyse large data sets has already been proven and in use in industries such as medical, retail and education, amongst others. In the medical industry in particular, the move towards things such as digitisation of patient records and audio recordings of consultations which can be automatically transcribed may result in better patient care where doctors and nurses are not engaging in time-consuming administrative actions and are instead able to improve quality of care by focusing on more important issues (McQuilkin 2020), with NLP‑based data mining able to collect and produce relevant information from various sources.The use of devices utilising NLP such as the Alexa voice support on the Amazon Firestick also has great benefit in terms of allowing users to easily access content, particularly those who may be elderly or disabled by simply verbally asking these devices to complete an action.The prevalence of text-based and speech-based chatbots on a variety of different platforms has also had a major positive impact both in terms of individuals and businesses.  While customers are receiving more targeted assistance and faster solutions to their issues, businesses are also able to save costs and increase efficiency by reallocating their labour force to perform higher order tasks that would be difficult for computers to complete.

                    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                    <h2>(By Steven Pigatto. S3851506)</h2>
                    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    <p>Cyber threats have come to be more prominent in the early 2000’s this is when the internet was more available for people to start using it. Once coding was available, 
			    threats such as malware coding could be produced. With the world fast approaching modern technology, which will result in a big surge of threats daily, 
			    A virus that was circulating in the 2000’s was affecting Microsoft systems called “ILOVEYOU” which was an attachment on an e-mail. 
			    This caused damage to data and would also send copies to people on your e-mail list. </p>
		<p>Cybersecurity is a practice for protecting systems, network, and programs from digital attacks.
			The practice enables defending against malware, Phishing via e-mail, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and ransom attacks on personal and 
			corporate sensitive data. Cybersecurity provides a layer of protection against any threat that arises against data, infrastructure and tools that could be 
			stolen. It has become one of the most important tools due to the increase of activate movement of data and sensitive information over the internet.  </p>
		<p>Humans are the weakest link when it comes to cybersecurity. Human errors recur and that’s when computer systems come vulnerable. This is when countermeasures are required. 
			Software, hardware, and procedures is requiring preventing applications from external threats. Software design and security development has become more important.
			As more application are enable to accessible over the network, this would result in more threats. 
			This has applications building its own security to try minimising unauthorized code trying to manipulate data.</p>
		<p>Countermeasures have been put into place to prevent threats or unauthorized users accessing information or hardware.
			Different software and have been developed to prevent attacks:</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Security system</strong> helps control any access to the computer. The security system can also block any traffic that it concedes to be harmful to the system. 
			    The software is design to restrict incoming or outgoing traffic and protects data from applications installed on the computer.</p>
	           
					<p> <strong>Routers</strong>are able to prevent IP addresses of the user’s computer be visible on the net to prevent hacking.
			   The VPN is the identity of the network, the router helps to protect all activity and its identity, by doing this helps prevent any data theft.</p>
			
					<p><strong>Encryption software</strong> is when messages that are sent would be converted into meaningless text.
				The software is design to keep sensitive information to be kept secret and can only be decrypted by the receiver.
				The decrypted software converts the encrypted text back to the correct format.</p>
		        
					<p><strong>Anti-virus programs</strong>help protect your computer from virus. Virus such as malware can apply itself to applications by coding. 
				The anti-virus software scans the computer files to identify any threats inside your system and removes them.</p>
				
					<p><strong>Spyware detection software</strong> is design to remove any traces of spyware in your computer system. 
					Spyware is design to prevent any glitches in your system, therefore users do not detect the attachment. 
						Spyware can be in malware form or through cookies, the tracking system of your internet.</p>
			
				<p><strong>Biometric Authentication Systems</strong> works by comparing two sets of data which the data requires to be nearly identical. 
					Once the data is matched, it will give the required access to the person.
					The data cannot be exactly matched because it is impossible to have two sets 100% the same. 
					This helps prevent hackers be able to get access to the sensitive information or hardware because it's harder for them to collect the
					information unless they are near you. However, If the system was bypassed, the hacker risks getting caught easer then an outside hacker. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Biometric methods:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fingerprint scanners.</li>
                            <li>Retina scanners.</li>
                            <li></li>
                            <li>Iris scanners.</li>
                            <li>Speaker recognition. </li>
                            <li>Facial recognition systems.</li>
                            <li>Hand and finger geometry. </li>
                            <li>Vein geometry. </li>
                            <li>DNA based.</li>
                            <li>Behavioural Identifiers such as Typing recognition and Gait biometrics. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>What is the Likely Impact?</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the future facing more threats due to the extant on technology has been available, Organizations must be smarter in how they protect their data.
			    This is when the following methods come in place according to Navigating New Cyber Risks pp 125-135 Under Future Solitons written by Ganna Pogrebna and Mark Skilton.</p>
			    <p><br>Scenario Testing:<br> Organizations could simulate different attacks to understand the potential impact it could have on their business. 
				    By doing this, the data that was collected can be used to create a risk assessment and develop a risk management plain to try stop any future attacks.</p>
			<p><br>Terraforming Cyberspace:<br>This exciting technology would be hard to get pass by.
				Terraforming would work by removing any possible human related risks such as human errors or abuse to the software and hardware. 
				The technology would possible be ran by AI or quantum computing. Terraforming could be reality soon and this could eliminate the use of Cybersecurity analysts.</p>
				<p.<br> Cryptography of the Future:<br>With new developing technology fast approaching, using encryption will become obsolete.
					Other tools to help keep and manage passwords safe at the highest level of security will be the way of the future.</p>
					<p><br>Zero-knowledge proofs:<br>defined as “a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that something is true,
						without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true” If this vision is successfully adopted, 
						it would be very use-full in levels which could protect people’s identity and privacy.</p>
						<p><br>Mobile Targets:<br>An attack on a mobile which resulted in data breaches would require the Tech company to adjust all data that was 
							attached and the toolbox as well. Instead of doing this, creating an index for the targeted phone would make it impossible for the hacker
							to do their job.</p>
							<p><br>Algorithmic active Cyber defence:<br>This type of defence uses traps to help lure and capture any interruptions caused by hackers.
								This technology is already in place. The future for this technology will be more practice in systems in the future. 
								The traps would be well calculated that it would be more effective in capturing, diagnostics, and even future threats. 
								The future of Cybersecurity looks strong. Having this possible innovative technology to fight cybercrime would be harder for 
								any breaches to occur. However, the impact in having them in place could cost jobs. 
								It would replace an entire range of cyber jobs because it would be less human interactive because majority would be algorithm 
								controlled. </p>
                    <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
		<p>Growing up in the early 90’s and the 2000’s and see the advancement of technology was so excited I could not get enough of it.
			I remember the diel up internet which I thought was the bees’ knees. Playing games and chatting to friends on MSN and IQ after school while doing homework was fun. 
			I do not recall anything about security, except for a Firewall and Anti-Virus software. Back then, I did not know what that was out there could harm the computer. </p>
		<p>After doing this research, I have learnt a lot of dangerous software in the cyber web that could do lots of damage that I was not aware of existence.
			This is a real revelation, not just for myself but for my family and friends as well.</p>
		<p>With technology advancing each year, more dangerous the world wide web will become. Having a 5-year-old with iPad is concerning because they access the web. 
			I rely on Apple’s security system to keep the iPad safe from harmful things.
			Sure, I could just monitor the usage, but I cannot be there 24/7. If the iPad were compromised, my phone could be next due to the linking of Apple products.</p>
		<p>Seeing new software emerge in the market is a good sign we will be protected from outside interference. Having products with the latest security features such as fingerprinting, 
			and face recognition software installed is a wonderful thing. Not only it will stop unauthorized access but also protecting all our information and all passwords.
			However, the fingerprint scanning can be time consuming because sometimes and it fail then you need to go through the process of putting your passwords in.  </p>
		<p>Looking into the future, I feel at ease for my growing family. My kids will have one of the strongest security systems in the world working before they understand about all this.
			But having all this security still does not stop online behaviour such as bullying.
			We should investigate software that detects unwanted behaviour so we could stamp it out completely. </p>

					<h2>CONVERSATIONAL/FAQ CHATTERBOT</h2>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>There are many different chatbots in use in today's society. While the majority are made for businesses to improve customer service while also minimising costs, 
						there are also chatbots created for other uses, such as conversational tools or entertainment.
						For example, Endurance is a Russian technology company that in conjunction with four US universities began an open-source project to create a chatbot
						that provides patients living with Alzheimer's an ability to communicate while also enabling doctors to monitor
						the progression of the disease through detecting deviations in normal conversational patterns between the user and the chatbot (Oswald 2018).</p>
					<p>As a group, we have decided to attempt to expand on and progress the project idea of Cristopher from assessment 1, being a chatbot.
						A chatbot is extremely versatile, so that one can be adapted for any type of industry. For this project, we will attempt to link a chatbot to a website to provide easy to 
						access information that is presented on the website, or to allow the users to have a general chat with the chatbot as a communication tool. </p>
					
					<p><img id ="bot.png" src="./img/#" alt="Robot Face" />
					(Rossi Intelligence, 6 November 2016)
					</p>
					
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>A chatbot enables businesses to put a layer of automation or self-service in front of customers in a friendly and familiar way. Bots are quickly becoming a key component,
						from providing customer service to a user or answering their questions to just simply carrying on a conversation in some cases.  </p>
					
					<p>To better understand the opportunity for chatbots in the market, a survey shows the most common frustrations using online services such as messaging apps, 
						search engines, and product/service websites are: </p>
					
					<p><img id ="chatgraph.png" src="./img/#" alt="graph" />
					(“2018, State of Chatbots Report”) 
					</p>
					
					<p>Consumers at some point might be introduced to such technology ("Chatbots") that no question will be left unanswered,
						with the assistance of this "emerging real-world solution"(2018, state of Chatbots). Online businesses offer a great variety of products and services. 
						Although, more attention needs to be emphasized on the good timing when a customer is looking for some information, which could be detrimental for a prospect's 
						future transaction for any business in general. Demanding consumers are on the look 24/7, and often after hours, hardly anyone answers questions immediately. 
						Because of time and customer care, there is always a chance that by having a Chatbot, a business can maximize its financial return or customer satisfaction. </p>
					
					<h3>Description</h3>
					
					<p>Often when you open a website, a little chatbot appears on the page waiting for you to click on it so that it can provide you with some type of assistance. 
						The icon can be anything - from a little box with a question mark on it to a graphic of a person that pops up with some form of a "How can I help you" message. 
						They can also provide different services for users.  </p>
					
					<p>“Drift’s 1.000 plus participants” survey (2018, State of Chatbots Report) reflected that the most common uses for chatbots consumers might need are: </p>
					<p><img id ="chatgraph2.png" src="./img/#" alt="graph" />
						(2018, State of Chatbots Report)</p>
					
					<p>Also, it is worth noting that 34% of consumers would use chatbots to have "human interaction". (2018, State of Chatbots Report)</p>
					<p>In a business environment, to keep up with consumer expectations now turning towards faster responses and 
						solutions and resulting in many customer support teams struggling to meet demand,
						more and more businesses are now employing chatbots to fulfil these expectations and improve customer expectations.</p>
					<p>As above, another use for chatbots is to provide social interaction, with the smartest chatbots, using the latest developments in natural language processing,
						machine learning and AI, being able to receive, analyse, understand and respond to a user's input (Drift 2021).
						For example, Insomnobot 3000 was created by mattress start-up Casper and provides insomniacs with an opportunity to have a
						conversation with a humanlike counterpart when the rest of their worlds are asleep (Johnson 2016). </p>
					<p>The aim of our project is to create an interactive chatbot that provides both a FAQ and conversational function and attach it to a
						website which outlines the process that we as a team would expect to follow in the production of the chatbot.  </p>
					<p>Given the name of our team, the chatbot should naturally take the form of a knight's shield that appears on the bottom of the screen. When clicked on, the knight's 
						head shall appear, bearing the first question, 
						asking the user what they would like assistance with. The user will then be presented with two options: either access information or have a conversation.
						Both options will then request the user to choose from a number of options. If the first choice is to access information, the chatbot will then show a list of subjects, 
						and will display to the user a summary of the information requested along with an option to take the user to the relevant part of the webpage. 
						If the user instead chooses to have a conversation, hopefully the chatbot will be able to analyse the inputs and respond appropriately, in a humanlike manner.
						The conversation may take two tones: serious or humorous, depending on the mood of the user. </p>
					
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>To create a chatbot, we first must understand how a chatbot works, and more important, 
						how it learns. Advancements in natural language processing, machine learning and AI technology has led to the development of the modern day chatbot.
						A chatbot must be able to receive text or speech and through natural language processing, 
						identify key words of phrases that will enable it to respond to the user's intent.</p>
					<p><img id ="chatbot_arch.png" src="./img/#" alt="Chatbot Architecture" />
						(Khodukina 2021)</p>
					
					<p>To start this project, we need specific technological tools that allow fluid development, the most basic tools being a laptop with moderate wi-fi available. 
						Though there are a number of ways that chatbots are created, for people new to the technology, we will use Python 3.8, and code the chatbot through the Python 
						programming language as Python has a specific inbuilt library for creating chatbots (Navlani 2020). We will then utilise Anaconda software (an open-source distribution for 
						Python), import statements (Python language), import Json (is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format), 
						import Pickle (it is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database), 
						import NumPy (most commonly used packages for scientific computing in Python), import NLTK (is a platform used for building Python programs that work with
						human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing), import from TensorFlow, "Sequential, Dense, Activation, Dropout, SGD". 
						Libraries are essential to complete any project concerning programming (2021,” Techgig”)</p>
					
					<p>There are two types of chatbots: rule-based or AI bots. Rule-based bots are mostly used for simple question and answer tasks, using the concepts of “if/then” while the more complex AI chatbots apply deep machine learning and artificial
						intelligence in order to interpret the user’s intention and provide a suitable response (Khodukina 2021). For this particular chatbot,
						we believe a combination of both approaches are needed as there are two components: the simplified request for information from the user,
						and the conversational format. Therefore, not only must we manually enter all the code that the chatbot needs, we also must provide it with machine learning 
						algorithms so that in the future, for each choice that the user makes, the chatbot is able to analyse the request, access its 
						database and provide the correct response (Carter 2019). </p>
					
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>To commence the building of the project idea certain skills with software development and technology platforms are required. 
						The following skills listed are:
						<ul>
							<li>Knowledge of machine learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a program that can help analyze and understand human 
								language to get the best out of the conversation, this is called NLP. </li>
							<li>Programming language skills in Java, PHP, Python and Ruby.</li>
							<li>A platform is required in enhance the chatbot. Examples of platforms are: Lobster, Smartloop, Botsify, Hyro etc.</li> 
					</ul>
					<p>Once the chatbot is created, tracking and making updates to enhance its intelligence is required.
						The conversation the bot engages in, all the input data, words, will be analysed to enhance the bot’s intelligence. 
						The bot requires great conversation skills such as welcoming and guidance messages to engage with the user with its request.  </p>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>Chatbots are a way of giving fast delivery to any question and eventually incrementing sales. In a business environment, this technology has many benefits including improved customer satisfaction, cost reductions and labour efficiency.
						Depending on how much customization they make to the chatbot, there is an increased value to the business. 
						However, they have not only been utilised in the business environment, but also in other industries such as the medical industry,
						with chatbots that help to diagnose conditions, such as MedWhat, or in the entertainment industry, 
						with chatbots such as the Zootopia chatbot in 2016 that allowed children to help a character from the film Zootopia solve crimes (Shewan 2021). </p>
					<p>In terms of this particular project, once it has been completed, we hopefully will have created a chatbot that is able to be attached to a website and provide the user with a great experience,
						whether by answering their questions or requests for information, or providing them an opportunity to have a generalised conversation if they require. 
						The process and the code that we use should be able to be customised for other businesses or individual clients. </p>

						<h2>INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION (200 WORDS EACH)</h2>
                        <h3>Michael Sy s3921688</h3>   
                        <p>
                            It must have been God’s will that I am belong to this group, “The Conquerors”. My teammates, consist of young skilful and talented individual who are all hungry for learnings and experiences. Our TeamWorks is amazing, we have a natural born leader who organizes our regular meetings thru Microsoft Teams, patiently making meeting’s agenda and recordings. Volunteers, who despite of busy schedule at work are willing to spend time and contribute their knowledge and skills for the success of this project.The challenges we faced for this project is the availability of everyone, thru time differences, workloads, other personal situations and lockdowns we were able to cope up and now we are on the finishing stage. There are also some technical difficulties such as using Teams and Github. I for example, considered myself as a novice for this project cannot make it without the help and support of my teammates. I constantly message them and ask for help and information specially on the technical side of it.Perhaps the one thing that I learned working in a group is to value the time and effort that everyone contributed to make this project a successful one. You cannot put a price on anyone's passion to make this happen. The camaraderie and respect despite just working together for about 3 weeks. The confidence developed that despite all things we can make it happen.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Cristopher Ariel Castro Inostroza s3923904</h3>
                        <p>
                            Team work most of the times stands for a challenge, working with different minds is often a valuable experience. Luckily, I had the chance to share and work with people with commitment. Working in a team allowed us to identify our strengths and weaknesses, making sure no one is left behind when meeting through Microsoft video Teams. It also made me more confident and gave me an awesome feeling that working with others can be an enjoyable experience. Effective communication was essential to carry out this assessment. Each one of us has a unique skill that makes us who we are.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                        <p>
                            The challenge is to put each other’s work together, to make it fit between each other’s ideas or frames of what is presentable, but in the end, we could agree on having different perspectives and have a great assessment delivery.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        <p>Get to know different opinions from my own and to realize that working in groups is a lot of fun.</p>
                        <h3>What will I do next time?</h3>
                        <p> It depends on the types of people we are doing the group work. I would use Microsoft Teams and GitHub again definitely.Pleasant experience overall and great           teamwork!
                        </p>
                        <h3>Steven Pigatto S3851506</h3>
                        <p>One week into the assessment, I was struggling to find a group. I couldn’t get a contact.
				I reach out to the members of this group to see if I could join. Just to be able to join this team I was excited to learn from others and learn more about teamwork. 
				Putting my head down and finding a group, I believe I went well because I was determined and persistent.</p>
			<p>I believe I could improve in the CSS area. I tried to help style it but didn’t succeed. 
                            I feel like I failed the team by not able to contribute to that area. So, I would like to work more on learning the styling coding.</p>
			<p>English wasn’t my greatest subject in school. The assessment tested me with word limits, especially not knowing something I’m familiar with, Cybersecurity. 
				It was a great challenge to do the research and learn the technology.
				Putting it all together in 900 words was a surprise that I was able to each that amount. But looking at my work, I feel great about it. </p>
			<p>Communication is the key to be able to work as a group. I’ve never worked in a group through Microsoft teams, and I’ve learnt that communication is an important contribution for an effective team in the making of projects.
				Without this skill, it will collapse, and the project will be a flop. </p>
                        
			
			<h2>GROUP REFLECTION  (400 WORDS AS A GROUP)</h2>
                       <p>Once the group was set up, and we found our feet by starting our first meetings, getting to know each other and trying to gel together went well.
				The constant communication on Microsoft Teams when someone had an issue, or an idea showed that a team environment was happy, and everyone was on the same page. 
				We would constantly consult with each other to get opinions on any changes etc. We believe constant communication was our strong point,
				which went well. Once the group came together, a team leader was born. It ran smoothly for everyone to choose a subject to work on. </p>
			<p>Reflecting on what could be improved in the group is a difficult one. It’s hard to find an issue because we feel we all came together nicely and worked things out accordingly. 
				The team is only young, eventually little issues most likely arise. 
				But if there could be one area it would be Microsoft Teams. We all feel that our skills could improve in the knowledge of Microsoft Teams and all the functions on this.
				The start was hard to try and find areas where tasks could be laid out and ticked off. 
				Sometimes we had issues forming a group call on the calendar, but it really didn’t affect us. </p>
			<p>Living in different states, having jobs and families can be a challenging to get together and discuss our project.
				Working on a time frame with our busy lives, our contribution to the team’s effort to help each other was a surprise. Why? We all have our own work,
				but we all got together and helped each other by asking if anyone was behind and would they like some help. 
				It’s a wonderful team effort by all, especially what is happening in the world. We thank and applaud our families for the support given to our team members. </p>
			<p>Working with people with different experiences and personalities on this project was interesting. 
				Each member comes from a different background and different lifestyles. Coming together and talking to each group member, 
				we learnt that our common is the same trying to learn and better ourselves in the future and be able to work in the Technology industry.
				We all know it’s the way of the future and we are striving towards it. Our team is enjoyable, by having talented team members, 
				all working together with no issues. We all look forward in this course to continuing working together. </p>
